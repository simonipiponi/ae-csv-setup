# CSV Link for After Effects

# File
In [this](/CSV.aep) file you'll find a basic setup for text dynamically connected to specific CSV cells and a basic CSV lower third setup.

## General Information about CSVs in After Effects
CSV (or Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format to store data in rows and columns. You can import and export them from Microsoft Excel or similar programs. However, I like to work directly on the .csv file in a code editing software (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), because of a quirk in the file format:
While being called "Comma-Separated Values", CSV files can have different delimiters (for example semicolons, tabs, commas), and Microsoft Excel will output semicolon-seperated values even if specified differently. On the other hand, **After Effects will only accept actual comma-separated CSV files.** To fix that, either export from Excel and replace all semicolons with commas in VS Code or use a simple [online helper program](https://onlinetools.com/csv/change-csv-delimiter) to do the job for you.
